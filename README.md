## We are group of scientist from Biochemistry department at Lund University, Sweden. We are interested in uderstanding structure and function of different biological mocules including viruses. We currently are holding journal reading clubs where we try to learn more about SARS-Cov-2 virus. As scientists we have capability and responsibility to analytically read, dicuss and share our thoughts with broader audience and we therefore we created this webpage. We plan to update regularly. We do our best in understanding and interpreting results from scientific papers we read, however we cannot have a full insight into quality of perofrmed reasearch and we may simply misinterpreted authors intentions therefore as with any scientific conclusion they should be taken with the grain of salt. We hope that this resource can answer some questions related to coronavirus without necessarily reading full scientific literature. We will format this page in question and answers schemes and we will always provide reference to the original source.

### Q1: What is the origin of human coronaviruses?
### A1: Human corona virus originates from bats and are transimted through intermediat organisms, e.g civet... (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20567988)

### Q2: How does the SARS-CoV recognize human cells?
### A2: SARS-CoV uses its receptorbinding domain (part of protien)to bind human enzyme(ACE2) thorugh tightly controlled structural interface (including a few mutations) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20567988)

### Q3: Why do we observe outbreak of coronaviruses in XXI century?
### Q3: "It is widely accepted that many viruses have existed intheir natural reservoirs for a very long time. The constant spillover of viruses from natural hosts to humans and other animals is largely due to human activities, including modern agricultural practices and urbanization. Therefore, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to maintain the barriers between natural reservoirs and human society, in mind of the ‘one health’ concept."
