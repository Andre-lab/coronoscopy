## Why do we do this?
We are a group of scientists from the Biochemistry department at Lund University, Sweden. We are interested in understanding structure and function of different biological molecules including viruses. Currently we  are holding journal reading clubs where we try to learn more about SARS-CoV-2 virus, or the "new corona virus". As scientists we have capability and responsibility to analytically read, discuss and share our thoughts with a broader audience and we therefore created this webpage and we plan to update regularly. We will do our best in understanding and interpreting results from scientific papers we read. However we cannot have a full insight into quality of performed research and we may simply misinterpreted authors intentions therefore as with any scientific conclusion they should be taken with the grain of salt. We hope that this resource can answer some questions related to coronaviruses, and  explain the scientific literature that we have read so that those of you who are not scientists can get some of the information that they supply.. We will format this page in question and answers schemes and we will always provide reference to the original source.

> Q1: What is coronavirus?

> A1: Coronaviruses are so called enveloped viruses. Their core which contains their genetic material, RNA, is surrounded by a lipid membrane held together by envelope proteins. On the surface, the coronaviruses have a protein called the spike protein which they use to recognize and bind to host organism cells.

> Q3: What is the origin of human coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19 virus)?

> A3: Human coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV originates from bats and were transmitted to humans via camels and civets. Other human coronaviruses have originated from bats or rodents and have been transimted through intermediate organisms to humans. The "new coronavirus" SARS-CoV-2 we don't yet know the origin of but it has been found that it has great similarity with a variant that is found in bats. We also dont know if there is other intermediate organisms involved in trasmission to humans.

> Q4: How does the SARS-CoV recognize human cells?

> A4: SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 uses its receptor binding domain (part of a spike protein on the surface of the virus) to bind human enzyme(ACE2) through tightly controlled structural interface. SARS-CoV-2 have a few mutations in the receptor binding domain compared to SARS-CoV but they bind to and recognize human cells at the same receptor, ACE2.

> Q5: Why do we observe outbreak of coronaviruses in XXI century?

> A5: "It is widely accepted that many viruses have existed intheir natural reservoirs for a very long time. The constant spillover of viruses from natural hosts to humans and other animals is largely due to human activities, including modern agricultural practices and urbanization. Therefore, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to maintain the barriers between natural reservoirs and human society, in mind of the ‘one health’ concept."

> Q6: Why do so many viruses that cause epidemics originate in bats?

> A6: Bats are known for hosting a wide variety of viruses, including the corona viruses. The bats seem to not be very affected by the infection by these viruses. The reason why the bats are not as sick from these viruses as us humans is suggested to be that they have evolved a different strategy for virus control. While lacking some components in the immune system, bats increase their body temperature when they fly and they have an increased metabolism. This helps them to stay healthy while the viruses can evolve in the bat population. When the virus spills over to other mammals or humans, the new host is not prepared for fighting the virus since they lack the mechanism that bats have.
